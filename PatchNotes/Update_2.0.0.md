Satisfactory 1.1 support. Switched to new FGPlayerStateComponentInterface which may have erased existing sample data.




If you enjoy my work, please consider my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4).

## Changed Stuff

- Changed how the mod stores data internally to use new Satisfactory 1.1 and SML 3.11 features.
  - This may have erased your existing sample data from past versions of the mod (I don't have existing saves to safely test on or time to make them, sorry), hence the version bump to `2.0.0`.
- Added Mercer Spheres and Somserloops to the default list of items to exclude from samples.
  - If you have not modified the mod config yourself, the list will automatically update to include these items.

## Fixed Stuff

- Recompiled for 1.1 support
