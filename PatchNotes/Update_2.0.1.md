Exclude 1.0's new space elevator parts from samples by default.

If you enjoy my work, please consider my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4).

## Changed Stuff

Additional recipes have been excluded from samples by default. If you have not modified the mod config yourself, the config should automatically update to include these items. Otherwise you can use the reset button to get the new defaults.

- Excluded the base game's alternate recipes for space elevator parts from samples by default.
  - These were previously allowed as a "reward" for unlocking the alts, but in retrospect, that wasn't necessary.
- Excluded 1.0's new space elevator part recipes from samples by default.
  - Oops, I missed these on the 1.0 support update.
